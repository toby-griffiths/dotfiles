# Composer aliases

## As thsi could be run multiple times, we need to clear any existing composer aliases first...
## but we need to make sure there's a composer alias before we remove the old one
alias composer=""
unalias composer
## Run composer without memory limits
alias composer="php -d memory_limit=-1 -d xdebug.remote_autostart=0 `which composer`"
